# HiAnime Browser

A minimal Android app that opens `hianime.to` in a hardened WebView.

## Features

* Loads the HiAnime website on launch.
* Blocks navigation to any domain outside `hianime.to` (including redirects).
* Cancels any pop-up windows or JavaScript alerts triggered by ad scripts.

## Building

1. Open the `HiAnimeWebViewApp` folder in **Android Studio Flamingo** (or newer).
2. Let Gradle sync and download dependencies.
3. Connect an Android device or start an emulator (API 21+).
4. Click **Run ▶** to build and deploy.

That's it — enjoy anime without intrusive pop-ups!
